# hello-world

This is Curtis, aka 'cie247'. Just some quick edits here to the README.md file in the 'hello-world' tutorial project.

Part of my whole effort to ramp up for the new job. I'd imagine that working with Github projects will be a part of my duties. Once I get the hang of it, I'm sure I'll be creating some projects of my own. Looking forward to it!

Wow...so here we are nearly a year later (4/5/2017) and I'm making an edit to the README.md file. For what it's worth, I've been busy. Projects, artifacts, certifications, etc.
